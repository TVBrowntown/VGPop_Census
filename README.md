Don't trust the /who on your server? Use this counter to poll the active players on your 3.3.5 server.

This addon is an Upport of VGPopulation and has added some additional queries. It will /who 1-79 and then 80. When searching through 80 it will search by race and location. It searches cities and all Northrend zones + instances. Also checks PvP maps.
